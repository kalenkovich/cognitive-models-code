# Experiment 1: The Word Advantage and the Effects of Visual Conditions

The experiment simulated here is based on Johnston & McClelland (1973).

**Task.**

Participants look at either a word (e.g., "READ"; "Word" condition) or a single letter embedded within
number signs (e.g., "#E##", "Letter with number signs" condition).
Then they are forced to choose between READ and ROAD, thus choosing between E and O in the second position.

There are actually two experiments: "Bright target/patterned mask" and "Dim target/blank mask".
In the "Bright target/patterned mask" condition, a high-contrast stimulus is displayed for a short amount of
time after which the patterned mask is displayed instead.
In the "Dim target/blank mask" a poorly lit stimulus is displayed for a short amount of
time after which it simply disappears.
